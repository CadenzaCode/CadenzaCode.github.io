                <div class="description">
                    Programming to us is an artistic expression of creativity more so than a means to an end. Everything we do is a labor of love and approached with the expertise like that of a master craftsman. Whenever possible, we prefer to build our products from the ground up without relying on third-party engines or frameworks. Free open source tools are used exclusively throughout the development process, whether it is for code, graphics or sound production. Linux is the only operating system you will encounter across the workstations at our studio.

                <div class="description">
                    As long time advocates for user empowerment, freedom of choice, Linux and
open source, we naturally take the right to privacy, both on- and offline,
very seriously. We do not ourselves collect, store or distribute any kind of data from
our users with our products. However, for apps available on Google Play, we rely on a couple of external services that do and they are listed here:<br>

<ul>
<li>Google Analytics makes use of device IDs and collects various statistics
about app usage and crash logs</li>
</li>
<li>Google AdMob collects data needed for its advertizing service</li>
</ul>

You can read more about these services over at <a href = https://policies.google.com/privacy> policies.google.com </a></br>
Any changes to our own privacy policy will be updated within this page.
